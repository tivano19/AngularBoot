there are some differences in the csv export feature between the new Reflex GUI and the old GUI.
Indeed, in the new Event Tab, the user has the possibility to search the events in database by some criteria (ex. payoff, event date, etc...).
Once the events are displayed, the user will be able to filter the rows, and sort them.
the CSV Export feature allows you to export only the displayed lines and in sort order.
in the Event Legacy tab, the export button allows to opens a modal and fill the criteria in order to retrieve the rows in the database.
the new behavior of the GUI Reflex, is much faster: it avoids us to make a second request to recover the data and to gain in performance.
Is the behavior of new export feature suitable for you?
If you agree with this new csv export behavior, we will fix the bug of the csv file format when deleting a line in excel and we will deliver the fix at the next release.
